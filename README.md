## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://c0mpute.com/install.sh | sh
```

That installs three CLIs into `~/.c0mpute/bin`:

| Binary | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `c0mpute` | Umbrella CLI: jobs, workers, modules, dispatch | this repo |
| `coinpay` | DID, wallet, escrow, payments, receipts, reputation | upstream coinpay project |
| `infernet` | AI inference workload runner | [infernet-protocol](https://github.com/infernetprotocol/infernet-protocol) (upstream) |

The c0mpute installer pulls each from its own release feed.

## What c0mpute does

```sh
# identity
c0mpute coinpay did create
c0mpute coinpay did create --role worker

# run a worker
c0mpute worker register
c0mpute worker start --gpu

# submit jobs
c0mpute transcode submit input.mov --preset hls --max-price 1.25
c0mpute infernet run prompts.jsonl --model qwen --max-price 5.00

# monitor
c0mpute job status <job-id>
c0mpute tui                              # interactive dashboard (react-blessed)
c0mpute doctor                           # full-stack health check

# trust
c0mpute coinpay reputation inspect did:coinpay:worker:abc123
```

The plugin form mirrors the URL namespace: `c0mpute.com/transcode`,
`c0mpute.com/coinpay`, `c0mpute.com/infernet`.

### Run the worker in the background

```sh
# quick, self-managed daemon: detaches, writes ~/.local/share/c0mpute/worker.{pid,log}
c0mpute worker start -d
c0mpute worker status
c0mpute worker stop

# or start attached and watch the log live, then press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-C) to
# detach — the worker keeps running in the background. Re-running -a while a
# worker is already up just re-attaches to it.
c0mpute worker start -a
```

### Serve models for "Distribute across all nodes" (infernet RPC)

To make a node count toward infernet's distributed inference for a model, the
worker can auto-serve it over llama.cpp RPC (IPIP-0033). This is opt-in via env
because the model and (for a primary) its GGUF are operator choices. c0mpute
builds the llama.cpp `rpc-server`/`llama-server` binaries in the background on
first run, then runs `infernet inference serve`/`primary` and the daemon
advertises it:

```sh
# slice nodes (≥2): donate compute for a model
C0MPUTE_RPC_MODELS="qwen2.5:72b" c0mpute worker start -d

# primary node (1): must hold the model's GGUF locally
C0MPUTE_RPC_PRIMARY="qwen2.5:72b=/abs/path/model.gguf" c0mpute worker start -d
```

Needs `git` + `cmake` + a C/C++ toolchain for the one-time llama.cpp build
(watch `~/.c0mpute/llama-build.log`). "Distribute across all nodes" lights up
once ≥2 slices + 1 primary are serving that model and heartbeating.

### Run the worker as a service

For a long-running node, prefer systemd (restart-on-crash, journald logs).
A ready-to-use **user** unit ships at
[`scripts/systemd/c0mpute-worker.service`](scripts/systemd/c0mpute-worker.service):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp scripts/systemd/c0mpute-worker.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now c0mpute-worker
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"        # survive logout / reboot
journalctl --user -u c0mpute-worker -f
```

Under systemd the worker runs in the foreground (no `-d`) — systemd owns the
lifecycle. See the unit header for GPU/role customization via `systemctl --user edit`.

| Layer | Language | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CLI binaries (`c0mpute`) | Rust | Static binary; no runtime to install on workers |
| P2P / chunks / FFmpeg | Rust | rust-libp2p, content-addressed storage, no GC pauses |
| Web (`apps/web`) | Bun + Next.js 16 | Apex landing at c0mpute.com |
| TUI (`apps/tui`) | Bun + react-blessed | `c0mpute tui` interactive dashboard |
| Future GPU kernels | Mojo | When a workload needs custom GPU compute (DIP-0009) |

There is **no central backend** — no Supabase, no coordinator daemon.
Discovery, dispatch, and verification flow through libp2p Kad-DHT +
gossipsub. Identity, payments, escrow, and reputation flow through
CoinPay DID. The only public infrastructure we host is static
(landing site, release tarballs, bootstrap seed list, plugin manifest
mirrors). See [DIP-0011](dips/0011-no-central-backend.md).

`plugins/` directory is for **marketplace metadata only**. Each plugin's
`module.toml` describes how `c0mpute` discovers, dispatches to, and (in
the future) lets users install/enable/disable it. The plugin's actual
binary comes from its own release feed.

## Quickstart (contributors)

```sh
scripts/dev-setup.sh                   # mise + pinned tools + bun install
mise run cli -- doctor                 # full-stack diagnostics
mise run cli -- transcode preset list
mise run test                          # rust + tsc

# build the c0mpute binary directly
cargo build --bin c0mpute
./target/debug/c0mpute --help
```

## Status

**Working today**

- `c0mpute` Rust binary builds; clap surface for `doctor`, `worker`,
  `job`, `plugin`, `transcode`, `coinpay` (passthrough), `infernet`
  (passthrough), `tui`, `version`
- `c0mpute plugin install <url>` chain-calls upstream installers
- `c0mpute doctor` cross-checks `coinpay` and `infernet` on PATH
- Apex landing at [c0mpute.com](https://c0mpute.com) deployed via
  Railway, dark CLI-aesthetic with `/`, `/getting-started`, `/docs`,
  `/contact`, `/terms`, `/privacy`
- `www.c0mpute.com` → apex 308 redirect via `next.config.mjs`
- `apps/tui` scaffold renders a placeholder dashboard
- 12 Rust unit tests pass

**Not yet wired up**

- Real CoinPay DID generation, escrow, receipts (DIP-0007 — depends on
  upstream coinpay project shipping)
- Real Infernet runtime integration (depends on upstream infernet-protocol)
- libp2p networking (`c0mpute-net` is a trait surface today; bootstrap
  design in DIP-0010)
- Plugin marketplace UI on the dashboard (`/plugins` page coming)
